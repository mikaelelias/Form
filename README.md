The form project aimed to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS over a period of 6 days.

As a layout reference, I used Front End Mentor, applying the structure of a form using concepts such as inputs and their required properties in each response field in HTML.

In CSS, the structuring of elements and their positioning were done with the help of flexbox, making the project and its spacing moreÂ proportional.
